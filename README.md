# Zurich Parking Availability Project

This project provides real-time information about parking garage availability in Zurich, along with current weather data from SRF. It's a group project developed for the ETH Business Analytics course.

## Features

- Real-time parking garage availability data for the city of Zurich
- Current weather information for Zurich fetched from the SRF Meteo API
- Web interface to display parking and weather data
- Future implementation: ML model to predict parking spot availability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

Simply run the main.py file:

```bash
python main.py
```

The web application will be served at: http://localhost:8000

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main application entry point
- `fetch_rss.py`: Fetches parking data from Zurich city sources
- `srf_weather.py`: Retrieves weather data from SRF Meteo API
- `schemas.py`: Pydantic data models for the application
- `static/`: Contains static web files including index.html

## Data Sources

- Parking data: ZÃ¼rich City parking garages
- Weather data: SRF Meteo API (data for Zurich coordinates: 47.3797, 8.5342)

## Future Development

This project will be extended with machine learning capabilities to predict parking spot availability based on historical data, weather conditions, and other factors.
